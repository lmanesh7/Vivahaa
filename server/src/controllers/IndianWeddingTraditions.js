            <p>
                While Indian weddings are predominately Hindu, there are also many Indian weddings that honor a different faith, like Jain or Islam, or even no religion at all. Additionally, weddings in India vary greatly based on geography. North Indian weddings, like Punjabi weddings, will look different than South Indian weddings or even Marathi or Bengali weddings. And at the end of the day, it's a couple's wedding to plan as they please. However, across the variety of religions, cultures and regions generally honored at Indian weddings, there are some traditions that are customarily celebrated at the majority of Indian events. We're taking an in-depth look at those customs and rituals guests can expect to see when attending a traditional Indian wedding.

            <p>
                While some pre-wedding and wedding-day traditions vary from region to region and across different religions, there are some standby wedding traditions that are customarily included in all Indian weddings. From the inclusion of turmeric paste to the presence of mandaps at the wedding ceremony, here are some details you can expect to see at the majority of Indian weddings.

            {/* <image> */}
            <p>
                At Hindu wedding celebrations this is called the Haldi ceremony and is a pre-wedding ceremony wherein the turmeric paste is applied to the couple for beautification and good luck. A similar ceremony referred to as Mandvo takes place at Bohri weddings. And Gujarati weddings practice this ceremony and refer to it as either Pithi or Mandvo. Meanwhile, Jain weddings have their own version of this ritual which is referred to as Bana Betai. And Vatna is the Punjabi version of Haldi. At Maharati weddings, the ritual is known as Muhurt Karane and involves five Suvasini, or married women, who are from the bride's family or friends or close relatives, applying a turmeric paste to the bride's forehead and face.

            {/* <image> */}
            <p>
                Many Indian weddings, especially Hindu and Jain ceremonies, take place under a structure made of four posts known as a mandap. In the Hindu tradition, the four posts represent the four elements: earth, wind, fire, water. At Jain weddings there is a ceremony known as Mada Mandap that takes place to sanctify the space before the couple and their family members enter the mandap for the ceremony.

            {/* <image> */}
            <p>
                Many Indian wedding ceremonies involve a ritual fire. In Hindu weddings this is known as Saptapadi and involves the couple taking seven steps around the sacred fire. Meanwhile, Gujarati weddings generally refer to this part of the ceremony as the Mangal Phera in which the to-be-weds take just four circles around the Agni. And at Jain weddings this ritual is known as Pheras—the couple takes seven rounds around the fire before sharing their wedding vows.

            {/* <image> */}
            <p>
                Brides at Indian weddings generally don lots of gold jewelry. However, even within the custom of accessorizing heavily with gold jewelry, many regional differences can still be seen. For example, Punjabi brides often wear a gold nose hoop while Maharashtrian brides complete their look with a beaded headband.

            {/* <image> */}
            <p>
                Most Indian weddings involve a pre-wedding event where henna is applied, generally known as the mehndi, or mehendi at Jain weddings. "Henna or Mehndi can be considered somewhat auspicious in many cultures around the world, but for Hindus, it is a form of adornment," explains Keshav. "The night before the wedding, there is a celebration where all the ladies present get their hands tattooed with Henna. The bride has an intricate design that usually begins from her calves to her feet and then elbows to her hands. Traditions say the darker the color, the more the mother-in-law or husband will love You!"

            {/* <image> */}
            <p>
                The Sangeet is a pre-wedding event that takes place at most Indian weddings. At Punjabi weddings the Sangeet is often referred to as Dholki. "The Sangeet ceremony is observed by most northern Indian communities; it is most popular among Punjabis and Gujaratis," explains Keshav. "The Punjabi sangeet generally includes performances of Bhangra and singing of Gidda songs. The Gujarati Sangeet ceremony is often accompanied by performances of garba, the traditional dance of Gujarat that involves women dressed in brightly colored cholis, clapping their hands, keeping in tune with the music and moving in circles. Also, Dandiya (2 sticks) can be used for performances."

                Weddings in Indian culture are filled with vibrant colors, especially bright reds and oranges. Especially in Hinduism, red is considered auspicious and, therefore, the color of choice for weddings.

                When it comes to Indian wedding guest attire and the ensembles you can expect to see the couple wearing, vibrant lehengas (or lenghas), saris and kurtas are commonplace. However, from region to region you can expect some differences. Notably, grooms at Bohri and Punjabi weddings may don a turban.

            <p>
                Close to 80% of India's population identifies as Hindu so many Indian wedding traditions are intertwined with Hindu traditions. From pre-wedding traditions like the Menhdi and Sangeet to wedding-day practices like the Baraat and Kanyadaan, Hindu weddings are steeped in tradition and beautiful meaning.

            {/* <image> */}
            <p>
                This is the parade that accompanies the groom's arrival, generally upon a white horse, to the wedding venue. At Punjabi weddings this is generally referred to as Ghodi. "Baraat is a celebration performed by the groom's family prior to the marriage ceremony," explains Keshav. "The groom enters by riding a horse, and a Dhol player will normally accompany the procession, along with all the family and friends. There is loud music, and everyone celebrates the journey to the mandap—almost like a knight on a white horse!"

            <p>
                "Mangal sutra is a sacred necklace that is put on the bride; it is worn as a symbol of dignity and signifies the promise for the couple to always be together," explains Keshav. "It protects against evil and consists of black and gold beads and nowadays can be a fashion statement. It shows people that you are married, and it's only to be removed if/ or when the bride becomes widowed."

            <p>
                Jainism is the sixth-largest religion practiced in Indian, after Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism and Buddhist, respectively. While Jainism is a minority religion in India, it is marked by many unique practices that set its weddings apart from those of the other faiths practiced in India.

            <p>
                Similar to the Baraat at Hindu weddings, the Ghudchadi at Jain wedding celebrations is the processional that involves the groom's Barat or Barati on his white horse. Prior to this, the groom's family will tighten his headwrap and apply tilak to the groom's forehead.

            {/* <image> */}
            <p>
                Traditionally known as the giving away of the bride, during this part of the wedding ceremony a rupee and some rice is placed in the bride's hand (this is similar to the Kanyadaan that happens at Hindu weddings). Following this, the Granthi Bandhan takes place and the bride will tie the ends of the groom's clothes.

            {/* <image> */}
            <p>
                "There are notable differences or variations in wedding traditions depending on your faith," notes Keshav of Indian weddings. "For example, Sikh weddings do not need a haven with a fire. Instead, they have a sacred book, and the priest reads from that. The bride and groom only circle it four times as opposed to seven in the Hindu faith. Guests attending a Sikh wedding sit below the holy book, so oftentimes cushions are placed on the floor for guests to sit on. In Hindu weddings, this is not the case, so everyone can sit on a chair."

            <p>
                Marathi, or Maharashtrian weddings, begin with an engagement ceremony that involves sugar and coconuts known as Sakharpuda. During a Marathi wedding ceremony, a ritual called Lajahoma takes place as the couple recites mantras while offering grains to the holy fire. Four mantras are generally recited, three by the groom and the final one by the bride.

                Prior to a Bengali wedding, Ashirbaad takes place as a blessing on the marriage. Once the wedding comes around Gaye Holudali, similar to a Haldi ceremony, will take place with turmeric paste. During the wedding ceremony a ritual called Potto Bastra takes place wherein the groom, referred to as bor, is offered new clothes. Then Saat Paak takes place and the couple ritually completes seven circles. Then, the couple will sit and face each other and Subho Dristi takes place. At this time, the bride, referred to as kone, will cover her face with betel leaves and then remove them to symbolize togetherness with the groom.

                Each Indian state brings its own flavor to the wedding celebrations observed within their communities.

                Telugu weddings begin with an engagement ceremony known as Nishchitartham, followed by Pellikuthuru which is the Telugu version of a Haldi ceremony and involves putting both oil and turmeric paste on couple's faces. Another notable tradition at Telugu weddings is the Mangal Sanan wherein the to-be-weds take a holy bath on the morning of the wedding day. This helps them get ready for the wedding and for worshipping Ganesh Puja while also warding off evil spirits.
