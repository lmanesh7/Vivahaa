      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '20px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>A Brief History of Hindu Wedding Traditions</h2>
      <p>
        Hinduism is considered the world's oldest religion, with many of its associated customs dating back to more than 5,000 years ago. It's important to note that the Hindu wedding traditions below aren't in the exact order they're performed since the customs' order depends on what the families want to do and what region of the country they're from. (Fun Fact: India is home to the most Hindus, with more than 90% of Hindus living within its borders.)

      <h3 style={{ fontSize: '18px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Prewedding Hindu Traditions</h3>
      <p>
        There are lots of beautiful and fascinating prewedding and engagement traditions around the world, and Hinduism has a myriad of them. Here are spiritual rituals that happen before the big day.
      </p>
      
      <h4 style={{ fontSize: '16px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Lagna Patrika</h4>
      <p>
        The lagna patrika is the formal engagement ceremony and announcement of the couple's impending marriage. During this time, the couple exchanges a written vow stating that the marriage ceremony will take place at a later date they've selected. The wedding date and time are finalized at the ceremony, which typically has a Hindu priest, also known as a pandit, writing down the marriage details and the names of all the family members involved. This Hindu wedding custom is done months before the special day(s).

      <h4 style={{ fontSize: '16px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Wagdaan</h4>
      <p>
        Another Hindu wedding tradition, wagdaan, may also be a part of the engagement. The form wagdaan takes differs from family to family but usually involves the exchange of a ring as a promise of marriage after the groom's father gets permission from the bride's father to have the wedding. The wagdaan typically takes place during an engagement party known as mangni (in northern India) or nischitartham (in southern India). This ritual is the equivalent of a Western-style engagement ceremony.

      <h4 style={{ fontSize: '16px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Roka</h4>
      <p>
        The roka ceremony is an extension of the engagement party and celebrates the union of the couple and the families. The two halves join together, exchange gifts, eat sweets and dry fruit and enjoy each other's company.
      </p>

      <h4 style={{ fontSize: '16px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Barni Band-hwana</h4>
      <p>
        Fifteen days before the wedding is the barni band-hwana custom, which involves tying a thread, called mauli, to the bride and the groom or the groom and his parents' hands. The purpose of this is to ask the gods for safety on the wedding day and a happy marriage.
      </p>

      <h4 style={{ fontSize: '16px', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Mayra or Mayara Ceremony</h4>
      <p>
        Mayra, also spelled mayara, often follows barni band-hwana and is the "maternal uncle's ceremony" in which the maternal uncles of both to-be-weds shower the families of the to-be-weds with gifts and treats to offer well wishes. Historically, they would also bring the dresses the bride and her mother would wear for the wedding, but that's not always the case with modern weddings in Hinduism.
